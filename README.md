### Hello!

My name is Justin and I'm a programmer that likes to make really random things, as well as usefull things that I use for projects from time to time.

Most of the languages I use are Java, JS, and Python.

I help maintain a Discord API Library named [BetterDisco](https://github.com/ElderLabs/BetterDisco)<br/>
I do things for this random bot called [Aperture](https://aperture.bot)
