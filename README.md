### Hello!

My name is Justin, and I'm a programmer who likes to make really random things and useful things that I use for projects from time to time.

I mostly use Java, JS, and Python (oh, and some Kotlin now?).

I help maintain a Discord API Library named [BetterDisco](https://github.com/ElderLabs/BetterDisco)<br/>
~~I do things for this random bot called [Aperture](https://aperture.bot)~~
I write random Minecraft mods/plugins that may/may not be useful ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
